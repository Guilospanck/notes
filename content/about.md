I am a software developer with a background in Mechatronics Engineering. I am interested in all things tech, but mostly those
that can provide sovereignty to the users.

Currently I am dedicating my free time to work on/study things related to the BTC ecosystem, in *hope* that we can all become a better society.

You can reach me using either [email](mailto:guilospanck@protonmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilhermerpereira/).
